The event will be staged in Centre 200, an arena which can hold 5,000 fans and is located in downtown Sydney on the island of Cape Breton.

While Canada is no stranger to hosting World Curling championships, this is a first world womenâ€™s championship to take place in Nova Scotia.

This will be the 45th world womenâ€™s championship, with the first held in Perth, Scotland in 1979. Altogether 13 of the top womenâ€™s teams will be representing their national Member Associations.

With Canada gaining participation as hosts, the other teams qualified through two different routes for this championship â€“ by way of their performances in the Le GruyÃ¨re AOP European Curling Championships, held in November 2023 in Aberdeen, Scotland, and at the Pan Continental Championships, staged in Kelowna, Canada earlier in November 2023.

From the European Championships (in qualification order): Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Scotland, Estonia, Denmark and 

From the Pan Continental Championships (in qualification order): Korea, Japan, United States and New Zealand

As well as having world titles and medals on the line, this event is the first of two Olympic qualifier world championships. With Italy already qualified as hosts, altogether seven national Member Associations will qualify directly for the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Milan-Cortina. The others will be eligible to compete at a Pre-Olympic Qualification Event and/or the final Olympic Qualification Event, held in the 2025â€“26 season.
